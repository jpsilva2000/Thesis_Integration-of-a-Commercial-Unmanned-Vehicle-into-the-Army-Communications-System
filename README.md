# Thesis_Integration-of-a-Commercial-Unmanned-Vehicle-into-the-Army-Communications-System

With the growing evolution of the battlefield, the advantages of using UxVs platforms in dangerous
environments or tasks for the military are becoming increasingly apparent. UxVs reduce human ex-
posure to danger in high-risk environments. That being so, it is important that the main information
from the vehicle can be seen by the commanders in the COP by integrating the vehicle into the Army
Communications System.
This thesis explores the integration of commercial UxVs in military operations, focusing on enhanc-
ing communication between these vehicles and their control centres. Global conflicts, particularly the
Ukraine war, have accelerated the development of autonomous military systems. The Portuguese Army
is investing in these technologies to lower costs and speed up the acquisition, development and inte-
gration of these capabilities. These platforms have improved decision-making and operational efficiency
and can be applied in the Portuguese Army and the other branches of the Armed Forces (AF). The thesis
contributes by developing a MAVLink library for UxV communication, hybrid tools for data transmission
using military radios and Wi-Fi, and unmanned vehicle navigation without dedicated autopilot hardware.
The solution developed was implemented using LAFVIN UGV and the tests were carried out with the
support of the SIC-T project team. After obtaining the results, it was possible to draw important values
and conclusions regarding using military radios — P/PRC-525 and TR5000H — for integrating a UGV
into the BMS.
